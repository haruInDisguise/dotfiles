# My dotfiles

This setup includes:

- A minimal zsh configuration (no plugin manager, small but functional prompt, ect.)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) setup with [Treesitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), builtin LSP ([using nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)) and 100% lua.
- EFISTUB support
- A clear structure, linking scripts, ...

I like to think, that this configuration is at least somewhat organized and quite readable...
